This repository contains two Python files, `file1.py` and `file11.py`, which together form a simple Linux controller program with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the `tkinter` library.

### Features

- Run various Linux commands using a graphical interface.
- Execute commands such as `date`, `cal`, SSH to remote machines, and configure an HTTPD server.
- GUI built with `tkinter` for easy interaction.



## Usage

1. **Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.**

2. **Run `file11.py` using the following command:**

   ```bash
   python file11.py
   ```
## Usage

1. The GUI window will appear, offering options to execute different commands.

2. Choose the desired command, provide any necessary input (for SSH connection), and press the "Enter" button.

3. The output of the selected command will be displayed in the terminal result section.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` library (usually included with Python)
- Operating system with a graphical user interface (GUI)

## Installation

You can install the required library using the following command:

```bash
pip install tk
```

## Advantages

- Provides an intuitive graphical interface for executing Linux commands.
- Offers a convenient way to interact with the system without using the terminal directly.
- Suitable for users who are not familiar with command-line interfaces.
